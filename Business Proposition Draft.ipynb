    "For my business problem, I have decided to look into clustering data from large cities throughout my home state of Indiana to find the areas with the highest rated music venues. From here I would like to reference their venue categories and ratings to find the top 5 all-ages venues, and the top 5 21+ venues available for musicians to play within each area. The intended end-goal is to create a listing showing the most profitable venues to play, while ensuring the audience is age-appropriate for material, and maintaining a large enough scope to avoid repeated usage of the same venue in order to maximize revenue for bands and venues alike.
